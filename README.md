# ConFTool

ConFTool is a configurable architecture-independent tool that applies state of the art SIHFT techniques [1] to targeted programs by modifying their assembly code.

Potential uses are:
* Provide low-cost reliability to microprocessors against soft errors
* Increase the observability of permanent faults in post-silicon validation
* Increase the probability of detecting hard errors in deployed devices

This project is the evolution of [2].
